Additional material:
- Front cover panels: transparant acrylic sheets. They are useful for not getting balls shot in your eyes. I laser cut these.
- Stepper motor NEMA 17HS4023 https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005004963609855.html
- On/Off switch, footprint hole in front cover is 13.7 mm high and 8.8 mm wide https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/4001165826718.html
- Arduino CNC shield V3 https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/32548695669.html
- Arduino, any 5V type will do
- Dupont wires
- TMC2208 stepper driver https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005003287937798.html
- Rotary Encoder Module Voor Arduino https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005002132981406.html
- Spring. I took one from an assorted spring package that suited.
- Metal balls, I used 9 mm ones https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005003281616396.html
- Power supply, I used a 12V I still had from an old modem for the stepper driver and used the voltage regulator on the arduino for 5V
- Threaded inserts for M2 (large gear) and M3 (rack).
- Bolts and nuts in M2 and M3 in various sizes, with O-rings.
- Bearing 17mm outside diameter, 6mm inside diameter, thickness 5 or 6 mm

Supports:
Everything can be printed without supports, except the back cover (or at least I used supports for the screwholes there).

Material:
I used PETG to print the parts, 0.4mm (default) nozzle size on a Prusa i3 MK2. 

Print profile and layer height:
Print settings are on the PrusaSlicer profile "0.35mm FAST" which has 0.35 mm layer height.

Infill:
I used 80 percent infill for the gears, rack and stand. The others I printed on 20%.

Can I use this model to:
Impress your friends or excite grandma? Yes. Make money? No.
